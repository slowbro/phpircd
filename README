phpircd v0.1a
this readme is a changelog lololol


7/10/2010 -
Error handling function introduced.
(edit 1)
Welcome message(s) progress. Need to figure out the 005 numeric which is nor RPL_ISUPPORT, probably 
going to just fill it with nonsense for now until the server is more complete and it is needed.
More error checking added on initial connect, check for parameter amount, and checks params against
some regex.
Dicks everywhere.

7/9/2010 -
Basically a plain socket server at the moment.
(edit 1)
Babysteps towards actual irc stuff. Closes link on ping timeout, working on initial connect sequence.
Expect ircd.class.php rolled out within a day or so.
(edit 2)
Initial ircd class release.
NICK error checking working for initial connect. USER next.
Still need to legitimately NOTICE AUTH instead of just sending that junk.

7/8/2010 -
Initial alpha-absolutely-nothing-is-done-at-all release.
